# AI-Driven-Calendar-Agent

SchedulAI parses your natural language event requests (e.g., "Lunch with Sarah tomorrow at noon"), extracts the details via an LLM pipeline, and creates events in your Google Calendar automatically.

### Features
- **LLM Extraction Pipeline**: Uses GPT‑4O to identify and parse event descriptions in three stages: detection, detail parsing, and confirmation.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Authenticates via OAuth2 and inserts new events directly into your primary calendar.
- **Agentic Design**: Acts as a lightweight AI agent—no manual form filling required.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your‑username/SchedulAI.git
   cd SchedulAI
